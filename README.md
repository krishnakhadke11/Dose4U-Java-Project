# Dose4U-Java-Project

DOSE4U is a User-friendly, and expandable application.

The aim of DOSE4U is to aid the forgetful and busy with remembering to take their daily medications. 

It is designed for users who need a little help keeping track of their medication schedule and who are dedicated to keeping the schedule. 

This is our Semester 3 Mini Project, based on Java and MySQL. 

Dr. Arun Kulkarni, HOD(IT Dept), TSEC, is our guide for the same.
